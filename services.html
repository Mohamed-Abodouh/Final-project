                  <h2>Safety Service</h2>
                  <p>This is the bare minimum service you should go for and is an option if you’re running pretty low on cash. A safety service involves replacing your engine oil, replacing your oil filter, checking under your bonnet, topping up fluids, inspecting belts and hoses and testing the battery. You should also get a vehicle safety inspection, handbrake adjustment, charging system check and cooling system check. While it’s certainly the most affordable option, a safety service will only really last you for 12 months or 15,000km.</p>

                  <h2>Major Service</h2>
                  <p>A step up from the safety service, a major service will cost a little bit more but will also last you for twice as long — 24 months and 30,000km, to be exact. It should cover all the things that are covered by the safety service, with a few important extras, including checking the engine management system, a diagnostic scan and fault code analysis, replacement of the air filter, replacement of the external fuel filter and non-platinum spark plugs.</p>

                  <h2>Premium Service</h2>
                  <p>Even better than the Major Service and lasting an extra year (36 months) and an extra 15,000km (45,000km total), a premium service should do everything you’ll get in a major service with just two small but crucial additions. First of all, in a premium service you’ll get your brake fluid checked. Some say that brake fluid doesn’t necessarily need replacing if it’s functioning okay, but if you don’t change it you run the risk of microscopic particles of rust wearing away your vehicle parts. Additionally, with a premium service you should get your coolant replaced.</p>

                  <h2>Ultimate Service</h2>
                  <p>It’s called an ultimate service for a reason — it does everything that the other services do and goes that extra step to make sure your car is in tip top shape for up to 48 months, or for 60,000km. In an ultimate service, you should receive an on-car fuel injector flush, throttle body clean, engine decarbonisation and fuel tank additive. It’s also the most expensive service but it will benefit you in the long run with a better-running vehicle.</p>

                  <h2>Interim car service</h2>
                  <p>Interim car service
                    It’s recommended to get an interim service every 6 months or 6,000 miles that your car has driven - whichever comes sooner.
                    All services will include checking lights, brakes, tyres, steering, suspension and all fluid levels. An interim service might also include:
                    <ol>
                      <li>Oil change.</li>
                      <li>Oil filter replacement.</li>
                      <li>Inspect drive belt.</li>
                    </ol>
                  </p>

                  <h2>Full car service</h2>
                  <p>It’s recommended to get a full service every 12 months or 12,000 miles - whichever comes sooner. A full service will usually include everything that’s in the interim service plus extra checks and changes. It could include up to 80 checks on your car. A full service might include: 
                 <ol>
  <li>Fuel filter replacement (for diesel cars).</li>
  <li>Air cleaner replacement.</li>
  <li>Alternator hose and vacuum hose inspection.</li>
  <li>Parking brake shoes inspection.</li>
  <li>Remove and rotate road wheels.</li>
                 </ol>
